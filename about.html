<h1 id="about">About</h1>
<p>Sonic 0023 is a YouTuber that started his channel off with a pretty bad guitar cover of “The Star Spangled Banner”. Of course, that didn’t stop him. His next video was about carving a pumpkin. At a few pieces in the video, along with the infamous “Two Hours Later” line, the video glitched. At the end, it seems like his alter ego took over the rest of the video. But, shortly thereafter, the famous YouTuber/bassist Davie504 said guitar was terrible. So, another video by Sonic 0023 went up, defending the guitar and challenging Davie504 to play a famous guitar riff on the bass. As of today Sonic 0023 is still waiting for Davie504 to accept the challenge. Sonic 0023 does programming in his spare time, and even has a Discord server, which he links in the description of his videos. An example of the sort of things he programs is this website, which is being hosted on GitHub.</p>
